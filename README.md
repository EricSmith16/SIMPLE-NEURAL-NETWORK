OUTLINE
============================================
A scratch written, regressive/progressive propagation therein gradient descent aligned artificial neural network framework program of mine, that reasonably models human neuronal phenomena.






DEMONSTRATION
============================================
The source sample includes demonstrations, configured via ( value * value * value ) neuron topology (this is extensible see ...USES); such that such:


i.Perceives handwritten numerals ( 1024x1024x10 neurons ). Conclusively, said neural network aptly perceives priorly unseen input numerals. (including terribly or incompletely written input numerals)

============================================


ii.Perceives xor input vectors ( 2x2x1 neurons ).

============================================




USES
============================================
This neural network utilizes a simplistic topological mechanism, therein encompassing the construction of sequentially hierarchically horizontal patterns of knowledge genera/perception.

EDIT 2017: A COMMENT ON THE [YOUTUBE TUTORIAL BY DAVID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkwX7FkLfug) USED 2 YEARS AGO TO BUILD 'SIMMPLE-NEURAL-NET' (WRITTEN IN C++)
============================================
Two years ago, I saw a [nice artificial neural network tutorial on youtube by David Miller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkwX7FkLfug) in c++.

I didn't know any c++ back then, but java and c++ are somewhat similar looking.

So back then I watched [the tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkwX7FkLfug), then for a little while I began to think about an overall picture of what was going on.

After 2 weeks or so of thinking, from scratch, I then transcribed what I learnt in the form of java code.

Surprisingly, the neural net worked well, and so I uploaded to github 2 years ago, to this repository....

Admittedly, this was not the best way of learning how neural nets actually work.

I may have gotten the model to nicely work back then, but I can't say I possessed an intuitive picture of what was going on. Of course this has now changed, as reflected in a recent book of mine called "Artificial Neural Network for 'Kids'".

IS [DEEP LEARNING](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) PAINFUL?
