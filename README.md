OUTLINE
============================================
A scratch written, regressive/progressive propagation therein gradient descent aligned artificial neural network framework program of mine, that reasonably models human neuronal phenomena.






DEMONSTRATION
============================================
The source sample includes demonstrations, configured via ( value * value * value ) neuron topology (this is extensible see ...USES); such that such:


i.Perceives handwritten numerals ( 1024x1024x10 neurons ). Conclusively, said neural network aptly perceives priorly unseen input numerals. (including terribly or incompletely written input numerals)

============================================


ii.Perceives xor input vectors ( 2x2x1 neurons ).

============================================




USES
============================================
This neural network utilizes a simplistic topological mechanism, therein encompassing the construction of sequentially hierarchically horizontal patterns of knowledge genera/perception.

INSTRUCTIONS

See [INSTRUCTIONS.md](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/SYNTHETIC-SENTIENCE/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md).





THE TUTORIAL USED 2 YEARS AGO (WRITTEN IN C++)
============================================
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkwX7FkLfug

I didn't know any c++ back then, but java and c++ are somewhat similar looking.
So back then I watched the tutorial, I thought about what an overall picture of what was going on.
After 2 weeks or so of thinking, I then transcribed what I learnt in the form of java code.
Surprisingly, the neural net worked well!!!



IS [DEEP LEARNING](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) PAINFUL?
